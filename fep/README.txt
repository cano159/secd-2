The SECD FEP is a variant of System09, written by John Kent.  It is
basically unchanged, but has been reformatted to be easier to read for
me.

Please see http://members.optushome.com.au/jekent/system09/ for details.

In order to be compatible with the memory map of Maisforth, I have
changed the memory map as follows:

0000-3FFF RAM
B000-BFFF I/O
C000-FFFF Maisforth ROM
